# FacebookDataAnalysis

This project aims to predict the number of likes a Facebook post will receive using machine learning techniques. The motivation behind this project is to help social media managers and marketers improve their content strategy by predicting the engagement of their posts in advance.

The project uses a dataset of Facebook posts and their corresponding number of likes, along with features such as age, tenure, friend count, and others. A machine learning model (specific model not specified) is trained on this dataset to predict the number of likes a post will receive. However, it was found that these features alone are not enough to accurately predict the number of likes, as they are also influenced by external factors.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The code is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
